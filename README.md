# Book Library Manager

This Vanilla JS website allows users to manage a library of books.

![Sample Image](assets/Sample.png)

## Features

* Add books with name, author, total pages, read pages, read status, and cover
* Set books as read or unread
* Change the number of pages read for a book
* Delete books from the library
* Responsive design

This website uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to manage the library of books. This makes the code more modular and reusable, and it also makes it easier to add new features in the future.
